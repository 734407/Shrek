<title>Shrek, the best franchise ever</title>

<h1 align="center", style="color:darkgreen;">Shrek</h1>

<p style="color:darkgreen;""text-align:center;">This movie is an absolute classic and it always will be. One of the best animated movies ever made and one of the most influencial films in history. It plays with the fairy tale genre in such a clever and creative way, and makes for a very good satire film that you can watch any time. The best part about the Shrek franchise though is that both children and adults can watch it and enjoy it. Go watch it now, make it the first film your kid watches.</p>

<h2 align="center", style="color:darkgreen;">Shrek 2</h2>

<p style="color:darkgreen;""text-align:center;">There is almost no words to describe this masterpiece. Not only the best sequal ever made, but it's one of the greatest films of all time. Every scene in this movie is wonderful, every joke is halarious, every refrence is clever, every piece of dialogue is memorable and quotable, and best of all, the characters are relatable and charming. Absolutely flawless.</p>

<h3 align="center", style="color:darkgreen;">Shrek Forever After</h3>

<p style="color:darkgreen;""text-align:center;">Wonderful, misunderstood finale. So many people hate this film because of what came before, "Shrek the Third", and think that the whole Shrek franchise was garbage to begin with, but obviously that's not true. You can ignore the existance of the third film and just move onto the forth and nothing will affect your viewing experience. Consider this the third film of the Shrek franchise, and ignore the existance of Shrek the Third. That's how pointless it is. On the other hand "Shrek Forever After" is a very good film. Maybe it's even better than the first one.</p>
